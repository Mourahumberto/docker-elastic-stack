Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

> :information_source: The Docker images backing this stack include [Stack Features][stack-features] (formerly X-Pack)
with [paid features][paid-features] enabled by default (see [How to disable paid
features](#how-to-disable-paid-features) to disable them). The [trial license][trial-license] is valid for 30 days.

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/master/docker)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/dev/build/tasks/os_packages/docker_generator)

Other available stack variants:
